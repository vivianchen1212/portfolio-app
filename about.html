  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <center><p class="desc">
  Chienyu Chen is an artist from Taiwan. 
  She was born in Taipei, Taiwan and received national compulsory education in Taiwan. Chen's growth environment has made her immersed in Taiwanese local culture, traditional Chinese culture, and various Chinese folk religious thoughts since childhood. These different cultural and religious thoughts have influenced her thoughts and values to some extent. Chen then moved to California, USA at the age of 18 to study at a community college. Changes in the living environment have had a drastic impact on Chen's adaptation to the environment, culture shock, thoughts, and values. During the process of adapting to life in the United States, Chen gradually became interested in the cultural differences between Eastern and Western. 

Now Chen is a student of Digital Media Art (DMA) at San Jose State University. Chen's life experiences in Taiwan and the United States have not only shaped her thinking but also enabled her to incorporate elements of the Eastern and Western into her art.

  
  
  
  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
  <center><p class="desc">
    I am Chienyu Chen, a visual artist.
    As an artist, I like to try to bring out all the wild imaginations in my mind through my works. 
    I often think about the possibility of different combinations of various materials, and how to incorporate the information I want to convey into my work in a symbolic way. 
    Therefore, the themes I explore in my works are quite wide, sometimes it is current affairs issues, social chaos, or my imagination.  
    I use both traditional and new media techniques to produce my works. 
    I currently use Photoshop, Lightroom, and iMove to create most of my digital media works.  
    Beside this, I am also learning how to use Illustrator, Dimension, and Premiere Pro to increase my possibilities in new media art creation. 
    I look forward to creating more amazing works through these technologies in the near future.

    
    
    
  <!---
    When I was a kid, I preferred drawing rather than singing and dancing. 
    I often draw for several hours without rest. 
    At that time, I thought that painting made me happy and relaxed. 
    Later, I discovered that painting was one of the few things that can always support me and ease my anxiety even at my lowest tide. 
    These factors also made me choose to embark on the path of art when I feel uncertain about the future. 
    At that time, my concept of art was still only in the exquisite paintings and majestic sculptures of the Middle Ages in Europe.
    At that time, I thought that art should be exquisite and elegant. 
    But after taking a few art classes, I gradually realized that art is very diverse. 
    Art can be delicate, scribbled, beautiful, creepy, strange, or even uncomfortable. 
    I think art is like writing to a certain degree. 
    Although each authorâ€™s writing style may be different, what is important to writing is not your writing style but whether you can clearly express your views to readers or whether you can present a touching story to readers. 
    Similarly, the quality of an artwork does not lie in its exquisiteness, but in whether its creator can convey a certain meaning or message to the viewer through the artwork. 
    The changes in my perception of art gradually changed the way I create. 
    When I first came to know various kinds of artworks that were totally inconsistent with my impression of art, I was repellent in my mind. 
    Meanwhile, my stereotypes about art were also broken one by one after gaining a deeper understanding of those works. 
    After I gradually accepted the various faces of artworks, I began to think about what made these artists/artworks affirmed. 
    Why are certain artworks so different from the public's concept of art but still regarded as a kind of art? 
    Why are some works that look like children's graffities deemed to be artworks and be displayed in art galleries? 
    After I started to think about these questions again and again, I began to realize how important meaning is to art.
    Although my current works still have many shortcomings, they will all become the nourishment for my growth on the road of art. 
    I will continue to learn and create better works. 
    And I will continue to convey my ideas and thoughts to the world through my works.
