  <h3>Beauty Standard</h3>

  <p class="tab">Description:</p>
  <center><p class="desc">
    Whether in advertisements, on social platforms, or between friends, we can always unintentionally and indirectly receive society’s expectations of women’s appearance. 
    Women have to maintain a slim figure, women without makeup are ugly, and women without hair removal are disgusting.
    Our society always use these odd standards to measure the charm of a woman or ask women to follow these standards.
    Ultimately, this causes many women to feel anxious and stress about their appearance.
    Therefore, I want to use this work to protest the vigilance about women's appearance in our society. 
    I use multiple found materials to create this glitched collage.
    In the center of this glitched collage is the famous sculpture of Alexandros of Antioch: Venus de Milo.
    Venus de Milo was praised dutifully by many artists and critics as the epitome of graceful female beauty. 
    The objects behind it are the epitome of the ways women use to meet the beauty standards. 
    Including zero-calorie salads for weight loss, cosmetics for a more delicacy appearance, and high heels for slender legs.
    In order to better express my thoughts visually, I chose to combine the photoshop skills I learned from this course and the glitch effect skills I learned from YouTube to make this work. 
    
First of all, I downloaded free images without copyright issue from Unsplash. 
    Then, I cut out the 
images I wanted from the original images and combined them together. 
    Then, I separate the red 
and blue channels of the image collage. 
    Then, I applied glitch effect by using Wave under Distort 
under Filter to selected areas. 
    Finally, I typed the slogan on the glitched image and repeated the 
method I did in third step to complete this work.
