<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p> I am Chienyu Chen, a visual artist. As an artist, I like to try to bring out all the wild imaginations in my mind through my works. I often think about the possibility of different combinations of various materials, and how to incorporate the information I want to convey into my work in a symbolic way. Therefore, the themes I explore in my works are quite wide, sometimes it is current affairs issues, social chaos, or my imagination. I use both traditional and new media techniques to produce my works. I currently use Photoshop, Lightroom, and iMove to create most of my digital media works. Beside this, I am also learning how to use Illustrator, Dimension, and Premiere Pro to increase my possibilities in new media art creation. I look forward to creating more amazing works through these technologies in the near future.</p>
