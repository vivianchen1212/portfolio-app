    The theme of this virtual room is depression. 
    The concept is to visualize the inner feelings of depression. 
    I turned this virtual space into a closed sphere, which is like the patient's inner world.
    It is closed and dark, and it seems that there is no exit to escape. 
    The various masks in the room are the masks that patients usually wear to cover up their struggles. 
    The eyes scattered around the wall of the room symbolize pressure from the outside world. 
    They seem to be monitoring the patient all the time and bring great psychological pressure to the patient. 
    Behind the visitors is a huge and broken mirror. 
    Mirrors are usually used by people to organize their appearance, but the mirror in the their mind have had broken.
    It is no longer able to make people see itself clearly, on the contrary it reflects a broken and incomplete self. There is another complete mirror in front of the visitors. This mirror is like a small window connecting reality and heart. Visitors can see the internal and external struggles the patient is experiencing through the image of this mirror. Models in the room The models in the room are all from Sketchfab.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The theme of this virtual room is depression.
    The concept is to visualize the innermost feelings of depression. 
    I made this virtual space into a closed sphere to symbolize the patient's inner world. 
    The models in the room are from Sketchfab. 
    The smiling mask in the room symbolizes the mask worn by the patient to conceal the confusion in their minds. 
    The eyes symbolize the gaze and pressure from others. 
    The broken mirror symbolizes its dilapidated heart. 
    Mirrors are usually used to organize or observe one's appearance. 
    But the patient's mind has been shattered, so the mirror in the patient's inner world is also broken. 
    Another complete mirror in the room is used to connect the patient's inner world and real life, so the video in this mirror symbolizes the patient's real world.
